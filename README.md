<h1>APP OVERVIEW</h1>

<h5>WEBSITE URL:</h5>
<p>Currently under construction...</p>
<p>The Fridge App is a responsive web app that helps people find recipies for the ingredients they have. Fridge-app aims to help reduce food waste by helping people use their ingredients to their fullest potential.<br>
<br>Firstly, users will enter the ingredients they have in their fridge into the search bar.

<br>Thirdly, the website will search the web using a python search script to find recipies which use similar/same ingredients.<br>
<br>Finally, the website outputs to the user a list of recipies in decreasing order of matching ingredients.

<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>
<p>
Wowie, if you've gotten this far... thanks for the read :)
<br>This is the first project I have ever made and I am thankful to Faizaan who has been the coder-inspiration in my life (thanks for being a constant inspo for staying on the grind man). I would also like to thank my current favourite hobby of sewing for showing me that taking risks is easy and I shouldn't be afraid to take a little more risks...afterall, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take!
